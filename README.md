# PhonePe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration

This project aims to analyze and visualize transaction data from PhonePe to gain insights and explore trends. The visualization of data will help in understanding geographical patterns, product performance, and customer behavior.

## Goals

- **Geographical Analysis:**
  - Visualize transactions geographically to identify regional trends, popular services in different areas, and target markets.

- **Product Performance:**
  - Evaluate the performance of PhonePe products (e.g., Wallet, Switch) through transaction data visualization.

## Strategies

- **Data Visualization:**
  - Utilize various data visualization techniques to represent transaction data effectively.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Perform EDA to uncover patterns, anomalies, and correlations in the data.

- **Insights Generation:**
  - Generate actionable insights from the visualized data to inform business strategies and decision-making.

## Tools and Technologies

- Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, and Streamlit for data processing, visualization, and creating interactive applications.
- HTML/CSS for custom styling and layout enhancements in the visualizations.

## Libraries Used

- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib: Basic plotting and visualization.
- Plotly: Interactive and advanced data visualization.
- Streamlit: Building interactive web applications for data visualization.
